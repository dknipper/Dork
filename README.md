This is actually three tools.

The first tool is launched from a console app. It scrapes the Google Hack DB Website, and saves all the data (i.e. dork/hack info) to a local database.

The second tool is a web application that allows the end user to query web applications for Google Hack/Dork vulnerabilities. The web application will generate all the links in which to test your web application.

The windows app can perform the functionality of the other two apps. THIS IS THE PREFERED APPLICATION. YOU DON'T NEED THE OTHER TWO WITH THIS. The ASP.NET MVC web utility, console app, and services were a bit over-engineered...
