# Google Vulnerabilty Scanner
Google Hack Database Web Site Scrapper w/ DB updater utility. 

Contains: 
1. ASP.NET MVC web utility for generating Google hack query links. IIS/WCF/Console
2. Windows application that can perform the same functions as the ASP.NET MVC App, plus syncing. THIS IS THE PREFERED APPLICATION. The ASP.NET MVC web utility, console app, and services were a bit over-engineered...

This tool is intended to be used to find Google Hack/Dork vulnerabilities in web applications. I originally wrote this for a friend who was scanning his site for vulnerabilities. The world was missing a tool like this.

---------------------

BE NICE WITH THIS. PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS FOR MALICOUS PURPOSES. USE ONLY AGAINST SITES WITH PERMISSION.

Repeat:

BE NICE WITH THIS. PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS FOR MALICOUS PURPOSES. USE ONLY AGAINST SITES WITH PERMISSION.

This is actually three tools.

The first tool is launched from a console app. It scrapes the Google Hack DB Website, and saves all the data (i.e. dork/hack info) to a local database.

The second tool allows is a web application that allows the end user to query web applications for Google Hack/Dork vulnerabilities. The web application will generate all the links in which to test your web application.

A Windows app that can perform the functionality of the other two apps. Like I said... THIS IS THE PREFERED APPLICATION. The ASP.NET MVC web utility, console app, and services were a bit over-engineered...
