# Dork
Google Hack Database Web Site Scrapper w/ DB updater utility. ASP.NET MVC web utility for generating Google hack query links. IIS/WCF/Console

This tool is intended to be used to find Google Hack/Dork vulnerabilities in web applications. I originally wrote this for a friend who was scanning his site for vulnerabilities. The world was missing a tool like this.

---------------------

BE NICE WITH THIS. PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS FOR MALICOUS PURPOSES. USE ONLY AGAINST SITES WITH PERMISSION.

Repeat:

BE NICE WITH THIS. PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS FOR MALICOUS PURPOSES. USE ONLY AGAINST SITES WITH PERMISSION.

This is actually two tools.

The first tool is launched from a console app. It scrapes the Google Hack DB Website, and saves all the data (i.e. dork/hack info) to a local database.

The second tool allows is a web application that allows the end user to query web applications for Google Hack/Dork vulnerabilities. The web application will generate all the links in which to test your web application.
